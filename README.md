# Hephaestuz ⚔️

**Hephaestuz** is a top-down action-adventure game focused on tight combat mechanics. Take control of a specialized warrior wielding the **Snipear**—a hybrid weapon that combines rapid melee-style strikes with a devastating high-precision Railgun.

## 🎮 Game Mechanics
- **Dynamic Combat:** Swap between quick attacks and a charged special shot to clear waves of enemies.
- **Precision Railgun:** A custom-calculated laser beam that pierces through multiple targets.
- **Adaptive AI:** Enemies that track and surround the player, requiring constant movement and strategy.
- **Polished Game Feel:** Includes *hitstop* impact effects and invulnerability frames to ensure every hit feels impactful.

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights
I built this project to explore the limitations of minimalist game engines, focusing on:
- **Custom Animation Engine:** Every character features cyclical animations for both movement and idle states to bring the pixel art to life.
- **OOP Architecture:** Clean, modular code using Python classes to manage game entities and state logic.
- **Trigonometric Systems:** Custom math-based systems for weapon aiming, projectile trails, and perpendicular offset rendering.

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. **Requirements:** Python 3.x and Pygame Zero.
2. **Installation:** `pip install pgzero`
3. **Run:** Execute the main entry point: `pgzrun hephaestuz.py`

*Developed with passion for retro-style action games.*
